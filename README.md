# machine_learning_from_scratch
Main Goal of Implementing all the major algorithm for machine learning from Scratch is to Create an Understanding of 
all the algorithm by coding them with the help of Numpy and visulising if required .
Here our focused datasets Are MNIST ,Breast cancer detection And IRIS dataset which is preloaded in Sklearn Library 
We will not use inbuillt algo's in this course
